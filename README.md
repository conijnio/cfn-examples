# CloudFormation Examples

This repository collects various examples that I use for references in my blogs.

To deploy the examples, you need to copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and set the `AWS_PROFILE` and `AWS_REGION`.
Next, navigate to one of the subfolders and run `touch .env && make deploy`.
